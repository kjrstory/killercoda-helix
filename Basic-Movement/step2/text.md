# Deletion in Helix Editor

## Deleting Characters

Type the `d` key to delete the character under the cursor.

1. Move the cursor to the line marked '-->' below.
2. Move the cursor to each extra character, and type `d` to delete it.

```plaintext

    This sentence has extra characters.
```

Once the sentence is correct, move on to the next lesson.
